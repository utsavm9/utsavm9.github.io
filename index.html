        <h2 id="header-2">Mathematical Expression Simplifying Program</h2>
        <hr />

        <p>This program is a term-rewriting program which repeatedly applies all the available rules to the
            expression being simplified. The rules are maintained in a rule book, which can be edited by the user. The
            program also comes with the capabilities of allowing the user to add and delete rules.</p>

        <p> The algorithm implemented for expression re-writing is based on matching and replacing parts of
            expressions. Numerous functions use several algorithms to achieve their task and some of noteworthy
            techniques are presented as follows:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Dijsktraâ€™s shunting yard algorithm for conversion into postfix</li>
            <li>File manipulation: creating, deleting, writing, appending, traversing</li>
            <li>Recursive function for calculating HCF</li>
            <li>Push and pop operations on a stack</li>
            <li>Window-like user interface with enter-less input functionality</li>
            <li>Pausing bulk writing on screen when text content start to move out of view</li>
        </ul>

        <h2 id="header-2">Cellular Automata Simulating Program</h2>
        <hr />

        <p>I developed this program to understand how animation and graphic-like abilities were achieved in the era of
            command-line interfaces. The program simulates the two simplest cellular automata: Conway's Game of Life
            and Wolfram's Elementary Cellular Automata.</p>

        <p> The algorithm implemented to achieve animation re-prints the entire screen for each generation. Some of the
            challenges we overcome in this project are:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Turning rectangle MS-DOX "grids" into a sqaure grid.</li>
            <li>Matrix operations</li>
            <li>Window-like user interface in commnad-line environment</li>

        </ul>

        <h2 id="header-2">Coordinate Geometry: Graph Plotter</h2>
        <hr />

        <p>Line Plotter is a math educational app that plots a quadratic function on the screen. It is a useful app for
            students learning Coordinate geometry as it helps them to visualize the graph and better understand the
            concepts.</p>

        <p> The app has the following features:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Plot quadratic and linear equations around the origin</li>
            <li>The facility to save the graphs for future reference</li>
            <li>Change the scale and the color of the graph</li>
            <li>The axes show numerical markings which adapt according to the scale</li>

        </ul>
